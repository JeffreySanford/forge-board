# Core System Gateways

This document outlines the primary gateways responsible for managing various cross-cutting concerns and external interactions within the ForgeBoard system.

## 1. API Gateway

**Theme:** External Communication & Service Orchestration

*   **Description:** The central entry point for all client requests (frontend, mobile apps, third-party services). It routes requests to appropriate microservices, handles request/response transformations, and can provide initial layers of security (e.g., rate limiting, API key validation). It simplifies client interaction with a complex backend.

## 2. Authentication & Authorization Gateway (Auth Gateway)

**Theme:** Security & Access Control

*   **Description:** Manages user authentication (verifying identity) and authorization (determining access rights). It issues, validates, and refreshes security tokens (e.g., JWTs). This gateway ensures that only authenticated and authorized users/services can access specific resources and operations.

## 3. Data Gateway / Persistence Gateway

**Theme:** Data Management & Abstraction

*   **Description:** Provides a unified interface for interacting with various data stores (databases, caches, file storage). It abstracts the underlying data storage technologies, allowing services to interact with data in a consistent manner. It can also handle data transformations, caching strategies, and schema management.

## 4. Notification Gateway

**Theme:** Asynchronous Communication & User Engagement

*   **Description:** Responsible for dispatching notifications to users or other systems via various channels (e.g., email, SMS, WebSockets, push notifications). It decouples the act of sending a notification from the services that trigger them, providing a centralized point for managing notification templates, preferences, and delivery.

## 5. Logging & Monitoring Gateway

**Theme:** Observability & System Health

*   **Description:** Centralizes the collection, aggregation, and processing of logs, metrics, and traces from all system components. It provides insights into system behavior, performance, and errors, facilitating debugging, monitoring, and alerting. This gateway ensures that operational data is consistently captured and made available for analysis.
