# ForgeBoard

## Overview
ForgeBoard is a real-time metrics dashboard inspired by 1970s engineering blueprints and technical drawings. It provides a unique user experience by combining modern Angular components with the visual language of vintage aerospace documentation.

## Features
- Real-time system monitoring with WebSocket connections
- Blueprint-inspired UI with animated components
- Typewriter-style animations and sound effects
- Multiple dashboard tiles for various metrics
- Interactive components that maintain the blueprint aesthetic

## Documentation
- [Coding Standards](./CODING-STANDARDS.md) - Development guidelines and best practices
- [Layout Specification](./rLAYOUT.md) - Blueprint UI design specifications
- [API Documentation](./forgeboard-api/README.md) - API endpoints and usage

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 14+
- npm or yarn
- Angular CLI

### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/forge-board.git

# Install dependencies for both frontend and API
cd forge-board
npm install

# Start the development server
npm run start
```

## Architecture
ForgeBoard consists of two main components:
1. **forgeboard-frontend**: Angular application with Material design
2. **forgeboard-api**: NestJS backend with WebSockets for real-time metrics

## Blueprint UI Philosophy
ForgeBoard's UI is built upon the visual language of technical drawings from the aerospace industry. It features:

- Deep navy backgrounds (#0d1b2a)
- Crisp white grid lines and borders
- Monospace typography (IBM Plex Mono, Courier New)
- Animated elements that mimic plotting machines
- Typewriter-like interactions and sound effects

For more details on the UI architecture, see the [Layout Specification](./rLAYOUT.md).

✨ Your new, shiny [Nx workspace](https://nx.dev) is almost ready ✨.

Run `npx nx graph` to visually explore what got created. Now, let's get you up to speed!

## Finish your CI setup

[Click here to finish setting up your workspace!](https://cloud.nx.app/connect/VJ0JqS6RsX)


## Run tasks

To run tasks with Nx use:

```sh
npx nx <target> <project-name>
```

For example:

```sh
npx nx build myproject
```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

[More about running tasks in the docs &raquo;](https://nx.dev/features/run-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects)

## Add new projects

While you could add new projects to your workspace manually, you might want to leverage [Nx plugins](https://nx.dev/concepts/nx-plugins?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) and their [code generation](https://nx.dev/features/generate-code?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) feature.

To install a new plugin you can use the `nx add` command. Here's an example of adding the React plugin:
```sh
npx nx add @nx/react
```

Use the plugin's generator to create new projects. For example, to create a new React app or library:

```sh
# Generate an app
npx nx g @nx/react:app demo

# Generate a library
npx nx g @nx/react:lib some-lib
```

You can use `npx nx list` to get a list of installed plugins. Then, run `npx nx list <plugin-name>` to learn about more specific capabilities of a particular plugin. Alternatively, [install Nx Console](https://nx.dev/getting-started/editor-setup?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) to browse plugins and generators in your IDE.

## Install Nx Console

Nx Console is an editor extension that enriches your developer experience. It lets you run tasks, generate code, and improves code autocompletion in your IDE. It is available for VSCode and IntelliJ.
