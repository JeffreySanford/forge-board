# Kanban Board

## Overview

The Kanban Board is a flexible visual task management tool designed to help teams track and visualize work progress through customizable columns and cards. It combines the best aspects of kanban methodology with our specific project management needs.

## Features

- **Visual Task Management**: Visualize tasks through cards organized in columns representing different stages of work
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Easily move tasks between columns as work progresses
- **Card Priority Levels**: Assign low, medium, or high priority to cards
- **Due Dates and Assignees**: Track deadlines and responsible team members
- **Tagging System**: Categorize cards with custom tags for better organization
- **Real-time Updates**: All changes are reflected in real-time across all connected clients via WebSockets

## Architecture

The Kanban Board feature is implemented with a clean separation between frontend and backend:

### Frontend (Angular)

- **KanbanBoardComponent**: Main component that renders the board interface
- **KanbanService**: Handles communication with the backend via WebSockets
- **Data Models**: Strongly typed interfaces for boards, columns, and cards

### Backend (NestJS)

- **KanbanController**: REST endpoints for CRUD operations
- **KanbanGateway**: WebSocket gateway for real-time communication
- **KanbanService**: Business logic for manipulating boards, columns, and cards
- **MongoDB Schemas**: Data persistence with Mongoose

## Data Flow

1. User loads the Kanban Board page
2. Frontend connects to WebSocket server and requests board data
3. Backend sends initial board data to the client
4. User interacts with the board (e.g., moves a card)
5. Frontend sends the action to the backend via WebSocket
6. Backend processes the action and broadcasts updates to all connected clients
7. All clients receive and apply the update in real-time

## Planned Enhancements

During our planning discussions, we identified several features for future implementation:

1. **Board Templates**: Create reusable templates for different workflow types
2. **Activity Log**: Track changes to the board for better visibility
3. **Card Filtering**: Filter cards by priority, assignee, tags, etc.
4. **Card Comments**: Enable discussion threads on individual cards
5. **Card Checklists**: Add sub-tasks to cards with completion tracking
6. **Automatic Card Aging**: Visually indicate cards that haven't been updated recently
7. **Integration with Other Systems**: Connect with issue trackers, CI/CD pipelines

## Technical Considerations

- **Performance**: Optimize for large boards with many columns and cards
- **Offline Support**: Consider implementing offline-first capabilities
- **Concurrency**: Handle simultaneous edits to prevent conflicts
- **Data Migration**: Plan for future schema changes
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the board is fully accessible to all users

The Kanban Board is designed to be a central feature of our application, serving as the primary interface for task management and workflow visualization.
