## Architecture

## üèóÔ∏è System Architecture

The Kanban Board feature is implemented with a clean separation between frontend and backend:

- **MongoDB Schemas**: Data persistence with Mongoose using flexible document structure

### Data Structure

The system employs a rich, nested document structure designed for flexibility and comprehensive project tracking:

The system uses a nested document structure:

- **Boards** contain multiple columns and phase information
- **Columns** belong to specific phases and contain multiple cards
- **Cards** represent individual tasks with priority, tags, assignees, and timestamps
- **Phases** track workflow stages (planning, development, completion)
- **Boards**: The top-level container, holding multiple columns and overarching phase information. Each board can represent a project, product, or team.
- **Phases**: Represent distinct stages of the Agile lifecycle (e.g., Inception, Planning, Design, Development, Testing, Completion). Phases group columns and provide a higher-level view of progress.
- **Columns**: Belong to specific phases and represent granular steps within a phase (e.g., "To Do," "In Progress," "Review," "Done" within the "Development" phase). Columns contain the actual task cards.
- **Cards**: The atomic unit of work. Cards encapsulate all task details: description, priority, tags, assignees, due dates, sub-tasks (checklists), comments, and activity logs.
  _(Visual Suggestion: A diagram illustrating this nested structure ‚Äì Board > Phases > Columns > Cards ‚Äì would be highly beneficial here.)_

## Connection Handling

4. **Reconnection**: Automatically attempts to reconnect with backoff strategy
5. **Storage Type Indication**: Clear indication of current data source (mock, memory, etc.)

## Sample Data

## üìä Sample Data & Board Templates

The system includes comprehensive sample boards to get you started quickly and showcase best practices. We also plan to introduce **Board Templates** (see Planned Enhancements) based on these successful patterns!

- **Planning Board**: Comprehensive project planning with multiple phases
- **Example Project Board**: Basic workflow demonstration
- **ForgeBoard Development**: Real development stories and tasks for our own team! —Å–æ–±–∞–∫–∞ (dogfooding!)
- **Security Initiatives**: Security-focused project board leveraging detailed Agile phases for tracking vulnerability remediation and compliance tasks.
- **Performance Optimization**: Performance-focused tasks, from profiling to infrastructure tuning.
- **Agile Transformation Board**: A meta-board to track the adoption and refinement of these Agile practices themselves!

## üîÑ Data Flow

_(Visual Suggestion: Enhance this with a more detailed flowchart, perhaps color-coding steps based on frontend/backend and indicating WebSocket vs. REST communication paths. Show the mock data path clearly.)_

1. User loads the Kanban Board page.
2. Frontend immediately loads mock data for instant display.
3. Frontend attempts WebSocket connection to backend.
4. If connection succeeds, backend sends real data to replace mock data.
5. User interacts with the board (e.g., moves a card).
6. Frontend sends the action to the backend via WebSocket (if connected).
7. Backend processes the action and broadcasts updates to all connected clients.
8. All clients receive and apply the update in real-time.
9. ‚ö° **Instant UI**: Frontend immediately loads mock data (or locally cached data if available) for an instant, responsive user experience.
10. üîó **Connection Attempt**: Asynchronously, the frontend attempts to establish a WebSocket connection to the live backend.
11. üîÑ **Data Sync**:
    - **Success**: If the WebSocket connection succeeds, the backend sends the latest, real-time board data. The frontend intelligently merges or replaces the mock/cached data.
    - **Failure**: If the connection fails, the frontend continues seamlessly with the mock/cached data, notifying the user.
12. üßë‚Äçüíª **User Interaction**: User interacts with the board (e.g., drags a card, adds a comment, updates priority).
13. üì° **Real-time Action (if connected)**:
    - Frontend optimistically updates the UI for immediate feedback.
    - The action is sent to the backend via WebSocket.
14. ‚öôÔ∏è **Backend Processing**: Backend validates and processes the action, persists changes to the database (MongoDB).
15. üì¢ **Broadcast**: Backend broadcasts the update to ALL connected clients (including the originating client for confirmation, or just other clients if optimistic updates are robust).
16. ‚ú® **Universal Real-time Update**: All connected clients receive the update and dynamically refresh their board views.

## üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling & Resilience

- **Connection Failures**: Graceful fallback to mock data with user notification.
- **Reconnection Logic**: Automatic reconnection attempts with exponential backoff and jitter to prevent thundering herd.
- **Data Persistence**: Local state preservation during connection interruptions (leveraging browser's local storage or IndexedDB for more extensive offline capabilities).
- **Data Persistence & Offline First**: Enhanced local state preservation during connection interruptions. Future enhancements aim for full offline-first capabilities with intelligent sync and conflict resolution upon reconnection.
- **User Feedback**: Clear, non-intrusive indicators of connection status (e.g., `üü¢ Live`, `üü° Connecting`, `üî¥ Offline - Using Mock Data`) and data source.

## Planned Enhancements

## üí° Future Roadmap: Planned Enhancements

1. **Board Templates**: Create reusable templates for different workflow types
2. **Activity Log**: Track changes to the board for better visibility
3. **Card Filtering**: Filter cards by priority, assignee, tags, etc.
4. **Card Comments**: Enable discussion threads on individual cards
5. **Card Checklists**: Add sub-tasks to cards with completion tracking
6. **Automatic Card Aging**: Visually indicate cards that haven't been updated recently
7. **Integration with Other Systems**: Connect with issue trackers, CI/CD pipelines
8. **Due Date Notifications**: Alert users when cards are approaching or past due dates
9. **Custom Fields**: Allow users to define additional fields for cards
10. **Board Analytics**: Provide insights into team productivity and workflow bottlenecks
11. **Board Templates**: Create and share reusable board structures (phases, columns) for different project types (e.g., "Software Development Lifecycle," "Marketing Campaign," "Research Project").
12. **Comprehensive Activity Log**: Detailed, filterable audit trail of all changes to cards, columns, and boards.
13. **Advanced Card Filtering & Search**: Powerful filtering by any card attribute (priority, assignee, tags, due date ranges, custom fields) and full-text search.
14. **Rich Card Comments & @Mentions**: Enable threaded discussions on cards with support for rich text, attachments, and user mentions.
15. **Enhanced Card Checklists/Sub-tasks**: Trackable sub-tasks with assignees and due dates.
16. **Visual Card Aging & WIP Limit Indicators**: Visually highlight cards that are stale or columns exceeding WIP limits, with configurable thresholds.
17. **Third-Party Integrations**: Seamless connections with Git repositories (GitHub, GitLab), CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins, GitHub Actions), communication tools (Slack, Teams), and other issue trackers.
18. **Smart Notifications & Alerts**: Configurable notifications for due dates, mentions, card assignments, and critical updates.
19. **Custom Fields & Card Layouts**: Allow users to define additional fields for cards and customize card appearance.
20. **üìà Advanced Board Analytics & Reporting**:
    - **Cumulative Flow Diagrams (CFD)**: Visualize work in progress, lead time, and cycle time across phases.
    - **Burndown/Burnup Charts**: Track progress against scope and time.
    - **Throughput Analysis**: Measure the rate of task completion.
    - **Bottleneck Identification**: Pinpoint stages where work accumulates.
      _(Visual Suggestion: Small mockups or descriptions of these chart types would be great here.)_

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Considerations

- **Scalability**: Design for multiple boards and large teams, leveraging MongoDB's scalability features.
- **Data Integrity**: Implement robust validation (schema and business logic) and error handling for real-time updates and data persistence.
- **Connection Resilience**: Advanced WebSocket connection management with heartbeat, automatic recovery, and minimal data loss during transient network issues.
