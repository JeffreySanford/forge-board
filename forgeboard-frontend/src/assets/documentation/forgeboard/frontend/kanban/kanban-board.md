# Kanban Board

## Overview

The Kanban Board is a flexible visual task management tool designed to help teams track and visualize work progress through customizable columns and cards. It combines the best aspects of kanban methodology with our specific project management needs.

## Features

- **Visual Task Management**: Visualize tasks through cards organized in columns representing different stages of work
- **Drag-and-Drop Interface**: Easily move tasks between columns as work progress
- **Card Priority Levels**: Assign low, medium, or high priority to cards with visual indicators
- **Due Dates and Assignees**: Track deadlines and responsible team members
- **Tagging System**: Categorize cards with custom tags for better organization
- **Real-time Updates**: All changes are reflected in real-time across all connected clients via WebSockets
- **Phase Management**: Organize work into phases (planning, development, completion) with progress tracking
- **Robust Offline Support**: Graceful fallback to mock data when WebSocket connection fails
- **Multiple Board Support**: Switch between different project boards and example boards

## Architecture

The Kanban Board feature is implemented with a clean separation between frontend and backend:

### Frontend (Angular)

- **KanbanBoardComponent**: Main component that renders the board interface
- **KanbanService**: Handles communication with the backend via WebSockets with robust fallback
- **Data Models**: Strongly typed interfaces for boards, columns, and cards

### Backend (NestJS)

- **KanbanController**: REST endpoints for CRUD operations
- **KanbanGateway**: WebSocket gateway for real-time communication
- **KanbanService**: Business logic for manipulating boards, columns, and cards
- **MongoDB Schemas**: Data persistence with Mongoose using flexible document structure

### Data Structure

The system uses a nested document structure:

- **Boards** contain multiple columns and phase information
- **Columns** belong to specific phases and contain multiple cards
- **Cards** represent individual tasks with priority, tags, assignees, and timestamps
- **Phases** track workflow stages (planning, development, completion)

## Connection Handling

The system provides robust connection management:

1. **Initial Load**: Loads fallback mock data immediately for fast startup
2. **WebSocket Connection**: Attempts to connect to live backend via WebSocket
3. **Graceful Fallback**: If WebSocket fails, continues using mock data seamlessly
4. **Reconnection**: Automatically attempts to reconnect with backoff strategy
5. **Storage Type Indication**: Clear indication of current data source (mock, memory, etc.)

## Sample Data

The system includes comprehensive sample boards:

- **Planning Board**: Comprehensive project planning with multiple phases
- **Example Project Board**: Basic workflow demonstration  
- **ForgeBoard Development**: Real development stories and tasks
- **Security Initiatives**: Security-focused project board
- **Performance Optimization**: Performance-focused tasks

## Data Flow

1. User loads the Kanban Board page
2. Frontend immediately loads mock data for instant display
3. Frontend attempts WebSocket connection to backend
4. If connection succeeds, backend sends real data to replace mock data
5. User interacts with the board (e.g., moves a card)
6. Frontend sends the action to the backend via WebSocket (if connected)
7. Backend processes the action and broadcasts updates to all connected clients
8. All clients receive and apply the update in real-time

## Error Handling

- **Connection Failures**: Graceful fallback to mock data with user notification
- **Reconnection Logic**: Automatic reconnection attempts with exponential backoff
- **Data Persistence**: Local state preservation during connection interruptions
- **User Feedback**: Clear indicators of connection status and data source

## Planned Enhancements

During our planning discussions, we identified several features for future implementation:

1. **Board Templates**: Create reusable templates for different workflow types
2. **Activity Log**: Track changes to the board for better visibility
3. **Card Filtering**: Filter cards by priority, assignee, tags, etc.
4. **Card Comments**: Enable discussion threads on individual cards
5. **Card Checklists**: Add sub-tasks to cards with completion tracking
6. **Automatic Card Aging**: Visually indicate cards that haven't been updated recently
7. **Integration with Other Systems**: Connect with issue trackers, CI/CD pipelines
8. **Due Date Notifications**: Alert users when cards are approaching or past due dates
9. **Custom Fields**: Allow users to define additional fields for cards
10. **Board Analytics**: Provide insights into team productivity and workflow bottlenecks

## Technical Considerations

- **Performance**: Optimize for large boards with many columns and cards
- **Offline Support**: Robust offline-first capabilities with sync when reconnected
- **Concurrency**: Handle simultaneous edits to prevent conflicts
- **Data Migration**: Plan for future schema changes with flexible document structure
- **Accessibility**: Ensure the board is fully accessible to all users
- **Scalability**: Design for multiple boards and large teams
- **Data Integrity**: Implement validation and error handling for real-time updates
- **Connection Resilience**: Robust WebSocket connection management with fallbacks

The Kanban Board is designed to be a central feature of our application, serving as the primary interface for task management and workflow visualization with enterprise-grade reliability.
