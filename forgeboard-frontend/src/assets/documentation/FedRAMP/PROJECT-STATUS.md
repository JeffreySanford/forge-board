## Executive Summary

ForgeBoard NX has **successfully implemented all required controls** for FedRAMP Medium-High Rev5 compliance and has proactively addressed the anticipated requirements of FedRAMP 20X. Our data provenance tracking capabilities and real-time monitoring systems exceed current standards, positioning us at the forefront of federal security compliance.

The platform is now in the final stages of preparation for 3PAO assessment, with comprehensive documentation and evidence collection processes in place. We anticipate receiving P-ATO by Q4 2025, well ahead of federal mandate deadlines.
