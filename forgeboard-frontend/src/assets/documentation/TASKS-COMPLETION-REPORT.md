## Technical Changes Summary

1. Fixed socket namespace construction in:
   - `c:\repos\forge-board\forgeboard-frontend\src\app\core\services\socket\modern-socket-client.service.ts`
   - `c:\repos\forge-board\forgeboard-frontend\src\app\core\services\socket\browser-socket-client.service.ts`

2. Updated documentation in:
   - `c:\repos\forge-board\forgeboard-frontend\src\assets\documentation\SOCKET-SERVICES-GUIDE.md`
   - Created new document `c:\repos\forge-board\forgeboard-frontend\src\assets\documentation\SOCKET-NAMESPACE-FIX-REPORT.md`

3. Verified correct implementation in:
   - `c:\repos\forge-board\forgeboard-frontend\src\app\services\diagnostics.service.ts`

## Next Steps

- Comprehensive testing of socket connections across all services
- Consideration of adding linting rules to prevent incorrect namespace URL construction
- Review other socket-based services for similar issues

All tasks have been successfully completed. The ForgeBoard application now has proper socket namespace handling and comprehensive documentation for socket service patterns and initialization.
