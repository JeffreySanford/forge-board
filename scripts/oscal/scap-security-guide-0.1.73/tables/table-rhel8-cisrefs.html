        "Firewalld" provides an easy and effective way to block/limit remote access to the system via ports, services, and protocols.

Remote access services, such as those providing remote access to network devices and information systems, which lack automated control capabilities, increase risk and make remote user access management difficult at best.

Remote access is access to DoD nonpublic information systems by an authorized user (or an information system) communicating through an external, non-organization-controlled network. Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless.

Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 functionality (e.g., SSH) must be capable of taking enforcement action if the audit reveals unauthorized activity.
Automated control of remote access sessions allows organizations to ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by enforcing connection rules of remote access applications on a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smartphones, and tablets)."

Detecting such changes and providing an automated response can help avoid unintended,
negative consequences that could ultimately affect the security state of the operating

        Protecting the integrity of the tools used for auditing purposes is a
critical step toward ensuring the integrity of audit information. Audit
information includes all information (e.g., audit records, audit settings,
and audit reports) needed to successfully audit information system
activity.

Audit tools include but are not limited to vendor-provided and open-source
audit tools needed to successfully view and manipulate audit information
system activity and records. Audit tools include custom queries and report
generators.

It is not uncommon for attackers to replace the audit tools or inject code
into the existing tools to provide the capability to hide or erase system
activity from the audit logs.

To address this risk, audit tools must be cryptographically signed to
provide the capability to identify when the audit tools have been modified,
manipulated, or replaced. An example is a checksum hash of the file or
files.

      <td xml:lang="en-US">
        When the so-called 'sticky bit' is set on a directory, only the owner of a given file may
remove that file from the directory. Without the sticky bit, any user with write access to a
directory may remove any file in the directory. Setting the sticky bit prevents users from
removing each other's files. In cases where there is no reason for a directory to be
world-writable, a better solution is to remove that permission rather than to set the sticky
bit. However, if a directory is used by a particular application, consult that application's
documentation instead of blindly changing modes.
<br />
To set the sticky bit on a world-writable directory <i>DIR</i>, run the following command:
<pre>$ sudo chmod +t <i>DIR</i></pre>
      </td>
      <td xml:lang="en-US">
        Failing to set the sticky bit on public directories allows unauthorized users to delete files
in the directory structure.
<br /><br />
The only authorized public directories are those temporary directories supplied with the
system, or those designed to be temporary file repositories. The setting is normally reserved
for directories used by the system, by users for temporary file storage (such as <tt>/tmp</tt>),
and for directories requiring global read/write access.
