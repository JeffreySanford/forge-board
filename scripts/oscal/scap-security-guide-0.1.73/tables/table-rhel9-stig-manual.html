	<td><pre>To mitigate the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by entities that have been issued certificates by DOD-approved PKIs, all DOD systems (e.g., web servers and web portals) must be properly configured to incorporate access control methods that do not rely solely on the possession of a certificate for access. Successful authentication must not automatically give an entity access to an asset or security boundary. Authorization procedures and controls must be implemented to ensure each authenticated entity also has a validated and current authorization. Authorization is the process of determining whether an entity, once authenticated, is permitted to access a specific asset. Information systems use access control policies and enforcement mechanisms to implement this requirement.

	<td><pre>System calls are special routines in the Linux kernel, which userspace applications ask to do privileged tasks. Invoking a system call is an expensive operation because the processor must interrupt the currently executing task and switch context to kernel mode and then back to userspace after the system call completes. Virtual system calls map into user space a page that contains some variables and the implementation of some system calls. This allows the system calls to be executed in userspace to alleviate the context switching expense.

Virtual system calls provide an opportunity of attack for a user who has control of the return instruction pointer. Disabling virtual system calls help to prevent return oriented programming (ROP) attacks via buffer overflows and overruns. If the system intends to run containers based on RHEL 6 components, then virtual system calls will need enabled so the components function properly.

	<td><pre>Without the capability to generate audit records, it would be difficult to establish, correlate, and investigate the events relating to an incident or identify those responsible for one.

If auditing is enabled late in the startup process, the actions of some startup processes may not be audited. Some audit systems also maintain state information only available if auditing is enabled before a given process is created.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

The list of audited events is the set of events for which audits are to be generated. This set of events is typically a subset of the list of all events for which the system is capable of generating audit records.

DOD has defined the list of events for which RHEL 9 will provide an audit record generation capability as the following:

1) Successful and unsuccessful attempts to access, modify, or delete privileges, security objects, security levels, or categories of information (e.g., classification levels);

2) Access actions, such as successful and unsuccessful logon attempts, privileged activities or other system-level access, starting and ending time for user access to the system, concurrent logons from different workstations, successful and unsuccessful accesses to objects, all program initiations, and all direct access to the information system;

	<td><pre>Without path validation, an informed trust decision by the relying party cannot be made when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted.

A trust anchor is an authoritative entity represented via a public key and associated data. It is used in the context of public key infrastructures, X.509 digital certificates, and DNSSEC.

When there is a chain of trust, usually the top entity to be trusted becomes the trust anchor; it can be, for example, a Certification Authority (CA). A certification path starts with the subject certificate and proceeds through a number of intermediate certificates up to a trusted root certificate, typically issued by a trusted CA.

This requirement verifies that a certification path to an accepted trust anchor is used for certificate validation and that the path includes status information. Path validation is necessary for a relying party to make an informed trust decision when presented with any certificate not already explicitly trusted. Status information for certification paths includes certificate revocation lists or online certificate status protocol responses. Validation of the certificate status information is out of scope for this requirement.

Audit records can be generated from various components within the information system (e.g., module or policy filter).

When a user logs on, the auid is set to the uid of the account being authenticated. Daemons are not user sessions and have the loginuid set to -1.

Transport Layer Security (TLS) encryption is a required security setting as a number of known vulnerabilities have been reported against Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and earlier versions of TLS. Encryption of private information is essential to ensuring data confidentiality. If private information is not encrypted, it can be intercepted and easily read by an unauthorized party. SQL Server must use a minimum of FIPS 140-3 approved TLS version 1.2, and all non-FIPS-approved SSL and TLS versions must be disabled. NIST 800-53 specifies the preferred configurations for government systems.
